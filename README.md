grails-seed
===========
Seed project for grails apps <http://grails.org>

This project is an application skeleton for a typical Grails web app. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your grails webapp projects and dev environment for these projects.

The seed contains Grails plugins, test plugins and a bunch of scripts all preconfigured for instant web development gratification. Just clone the repo (or download the zip/tarball), start up our (or yours) webserver and you are ready to develop and test your application.

Idea comes from similar projects like <http://github.com/angular/angular-seed>
